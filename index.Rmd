## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to sports or fashion. Whether it be data relating to sports performance or fashion trends, both industries are intriguing and use data science in different ways. 

## Proposal

Do alcoholic beverage Super Bowl commercials overuse marketing strategies in their ads? In this study, I plan to examine the marketing strategies of Super Bowl commercials selling alcoholic beverages, focusing on the amount of categories these ads present. There are six popular strategies of marketing categories: Funny, Patriotic, Celebrity, Danger, Animals, and Sex. I want to explore the average amount of categories alcoholic ads use in one of their commercials and compare it with other types of product commercials. I hypothesize alcoholic Super Bowl commercials do overuse marketing strategies because they are always very random, combining different things to be more memorable. Alcohol is also usually used in a less conservative setting, so it is usually presented in a more ostentatious manner. My sample is made up of various product commercials during the Super Bowl from several different years, along with True/False data under each of the six marketing strategy categories. My unit of analysis is alcoholic beverage Super Bowl commercials. My outcome variable is the average count of marketing strategies used per commercial. I will then calculate the average count of marketing strategies for other products like soda or car brands and compare. If alcoholic ads show a greater average number that means my hypothesis is correct and they do overuse strategies in their commercials. However, if there is a lower average number of alcoholic ad marketing strategies in comparison to other products, this would be evidence against my hypothesis.
